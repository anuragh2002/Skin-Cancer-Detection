# Skin Cancer Detection Using Image Processing and Machine Learning

Nowadays, people are most vulnerable to skin diseases and skin cancers are the most commonly occurring skin disease. Skin cancer is an alarming disease for mankind. Moreover, they need to be diagnosed in the early stage, because of the rapid growth rate of Melanoma skin cancer, its high treatment costs, and the death rate. These cancer cells are detected manually and it takes time to cure in most cases. This paper proposed an artificial skin cancer detection system using image processing and machine learning method. After experimenting with many different architectures for the CNN model, weâ€™ve built a Model of a Skin Cancer Detection System utilizing Machine Learning Algorithms. The features of the affected skin cells are extracted after the segmentation of the dermoscopic images using the feature extraction technique. A deep learning based method convolutional neural network classifier is used for the stratification of the extracted features.

We are working on detecting the different types of cancers using CNN architecture and HAM10000 dataset. Trying to achieve a minimum accuracy of 80%
